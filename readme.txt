Sync your posts with map2app, geo-locate them and create a travel app and/or a Google Map with custom markers, categories, images and descriptions.

== Description ==

[Map2app](http://www.map2app.com/) Connector enables you to easily sync your posts with map2app. Map2app is a powerful web based platform that allows you to create beautiful native mobile travel guides for iPhone and Android devices. It also allows you to add to your website a cool map with all of your posts geo-located and grouped in categories. Our maps (and apps) support text, images, audios and videos. Apps are distributed through iTunes Store and Google Play, while the maps can be added to your website as an iframe.
Before downloading this plugin be sure to create a map2app account. Don't worry, it is free and it takes less than 20 seconds. You can start from here:

Once you have your map2app account created install this plugin into your wordpress account and sync your posts with our powerful app creator. Once you are done, go to the map2app App Creator, customise the look and feel of your app, test it on your device(s) and voilat! Your app is ready to be published! No coding experience is required!
If you have a travel blog, a travel portal or a destination promotion website you should seriously give it a try. Map2app powered hundreds of travel apps that have been downloaded millions of times and that have an outstanding 4.6 stars average rating on both the Stores.
Remember that when travellers are on the go they will not visit your website for info but rather they will look for a mobile app that can be their travel companion.

**OUR APPS' MAIN FEATURES:**

* Each app is a mainly a list of custom categories (bars, monuments, beaches... anything you can think of)
* Each category can contain places, events and stories (called items)
* Each item can have a photo gallery, an audio, a video, a description and a bunch of other fields (telephone, email, etc)
* All the items are offline, i.e. the app can be used without any data connection
* All the places and categories can be shown on a map with a custom icon ad pin
* The map also supports pre-built custom itineraries
* Our apps offer extra modules such as "weather", "favourites", "map", "update", etc.

Beyond native iPhone and Android Apps, you can also export a HTML5 version of your app, i.e. a beautiful responsive map that you can embed into your website.
